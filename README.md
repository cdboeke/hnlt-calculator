# Honor Native Land Tax Calculator

This project is a collaboration with Albuquerque's Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) group. When completed, the Honor Native Land Tax Calculator will take inputs (TBD - however generally income, assets, etc.) and generate a suggested donation based on those inputs. It is inspired by the [Shummi Land Tax](https://sogoreate-landtrust.org/shuumi-land-tax/#tax).

This project is still in development.
