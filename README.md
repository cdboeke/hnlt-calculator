# Honor Native Land Tax Calculator

The Honor Native Land Tax Calculator takes inputs (TBD - however generally income, assets, etc.) and generates a suggested donation based on those inputs. It is inspired by the [Shummi Land Tax](https://sogoreate-landtrust.org/shuumi-land-tax/#tax).

This project is in collaboration with Albuquerque's Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) group. It's still in development.
