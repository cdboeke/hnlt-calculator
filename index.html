    <h2>Honor Native Land Tax Calculator</h2>
    <section>
        <p>Welcome to the Honor Native Land Tax calculator! 
        We created this calculator to help you think about your 
        relationship to money and the land you’re on, because we 
        know that money and finances can bring up a lot for each of us.</p>
        <p>One of the goals of this project is to redistribute wealth 
        from settlers to Indigenous people. As part of this process, it 
        is important that we as settlers reckon with our entitlement to 
        and possession of wealth. <span><a href='https://resourcegeneration.org/breakdown-of-class-characteristics-income-brackets/'>Our class conditioning strongly shapes 
        our values, beliefs, and expectations.</a></span> This calculator is a tool 
        to help bring some clarity about a meaningful monthly contribution. 
        We encourage you to think about your individual, personal relationship 
        to the land and to settler colonialism as you consider your contribution. </p>
        <p>This calculator is not perfect or “the truth” about what your 
        contribution should be—you know your circumstances best. If they
        are not reflected in the options that we have laid out, pick those 
        that are closest to your experience. If your situation is in flux, 
        do your best and know you can always increase or decrease your donation 
        amount as needed.</p>

        <h3>About the Categories:</h3>
        <h5>Individual Income</h5>
        <p>Consider all sources of income including, but not limited to: jobs, gigs, 
        rental income, dividends, commissions, money you currently get from family 
        members etc. </p>

        <h5>Housing</h5>
        <p>Consider your current living situation, including whether you rent or own.</p>

        <h5>Debt</h5>
        <p>Consider all student, medical, and consumer debt that you currently have. Do 
        not include mortgage debt, this is accounted for in the housing category. </p>

        <h5>Family Wealth</h5>
        <p>Consider wealth that you currently have access to because of family or other 
        relationships, as well as what you might inherit or owe when family members pass 
        away. Wealth you have access to or may inherit includes: money, gifts, stocks, 
        land and property, trusts, cars, etc. Negative family wealth means you don’t inherit 
        anything of value and have responsibility to pay expenses that come up when a family 
        member dies, like funeral, casket, legal fees, clergy, etc.</p>

        <h5>Level of Education</h5>
        <p>Consider your current status. We acknowledge that not all advanced degrees are 
        created equally—some have higher earning potential and social capital than others. 
        We’ve tried to account for this and we also encourage you to think about your 
        degree(s) in terms of social hierarchy (e.g. MDs and JDs often have higher earning 
        potential than MFAs).</p>

        <h5>Number of Dependents</h5>
        <p>onsider the people who rely on you for financial support, including children, elders, 
        or others.</p>

        <h5>Savings</h5>
        <p>Consider the money that is in your savings account, retirement funds (401k, IRA, SEP, etc), 
        investments in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds.</p>
