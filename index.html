        <h2>Honor Native Land Tax Calculator</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the Honor Native Land Tax calculator! 
        We created this calculator to help you think about your 
        relationship to money and the land you’re on, because we 
        know that money and finances can bring up a lot for each of us.</p>
        <p>One of the goals of this project is to redistribute wealth 
        from settlers to Indigenous people. As part of this process, it 
        is important that we as settlers reckon with our entitlement to 
        and possession of wealth. <span><a href='https://resourcegeneration.org/breakdown-of-class-characteristics-income-brackets/'>Our class conditioning strongly shapes 
        our values, beliefs, and expectations.</a></span> This calculator is a tool 
        to help bring some clarity about a meaningful monthly contribution. 
        We encourage you to think about your individual, personal relationship 
        to the land and to settler colonialism as you consider your contribution. </p>
        <p>This calculator is not perfect or “the truth” about what your 
        contribution should be—you know your circumstances best. If they
        are not reflected in the options that we have laid out, pick those 
        that are closest to your experience. If your situation is in flux, 
        do your best and know you can always increase or decrease your donation 
        amount as needed.</p>
